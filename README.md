# CIC-family modelling 2025

The code in this repository accompanies the manuscript "First Generation Tools for the Modeling of Capicua (CIC)-Family Fusion Oncoprotein-Driven Cancers" by Luck et al (2025). 
These files are not plug-and-play but serve to provide transparency for how we analyzed the data. They may need to be modified for use in different environments or with different data.
With questions please contact the lead author at cuyler.luck@ucsf.edu and the corresponding author at ross.okimoto@ucsf.edu.
For data generated by us, RNA-seq raw and processed (counts, log2cpm) data files are available at GEO, series [GSE295624](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE295624), [GSE295623](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE295623) and [GSE295625](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE295625) for the April 2023, May 2024, and Feburary 2025 data, respectively.

There are two main groups of analyses that the code is divided into, with the purpose of each file described below.
These files are also separated out based on whether they were updated during revision. Those from the original preprint that were replaced for revision are preserved at the bottom for the sake of transparency.

# Scripts used for the final paper after revision
## RNA-seq processing and analysis

***documentation_ATXN1_DUX4_Feb2025.txt*** : a text file describing processing of Feb2025 FASTQ files with STAR (and other tools) as performed locally on a MacBook Pro and on Wynton, UCSF's high-performance computing cluster.

***documentation_CICNUTM1_delE_May2024.txt*** : same as above, but for May2024 FASTQ files.

***documentation_CICNUTM1_April2023.txt*** : same as above, but for April2023 FASTQ files.

***patient_DUX4_vs_NUTM1_documentation.txt*** : same as above but for processing of patient CIC::DUX4 and CIC::NUTM1 data from [EGAD00001003121](https://ega-archive.org/datasets/EGAD00001003121)

***293T_ATXN1_DUX4_Feb2025_revisions.R*** : Updated during revisions, R script detailing differential expression analysis of Feb2025 RNA-seq data and used for plotting figures.
